privacychallenges in biometric usabilitymichael brockly, thomas cimino, chris clouser, stephen elliott, jacob hasselgren, rob larsen, kevin o&#8217;connor, tyler veeghfc2-00c.pdfthe purpose of this research is to explore the current challenges of the biometric community. with the use of biometric technologies increasing rapidly, it is important to develop potential solutions to these issues across a variety of modalities. from the analysis of earlier human-biometric sensor interaction models, the students in the lab have identified many areas for potential improvements which include the device, operator, and user.differential identifiabilityjaewoo lee and chris clifton75c-d67.pdfa key challenge in privacy-preserving data mining is ensuringthat a data mining result does not inherently violateprivacy. &#1013;-differential privacy appears to provide a solutionto this problem. however, there are no clear guidelines onhow to set &#1013; to satisfy a privacy policy. we given an alternateformulation, differential identifiability, parameterizedby the probability of individual identification. this providesthe strong privacy guarantees of differential privacy, whileletting policy makers set parameters based on the establishedprivacy concept of individual identifiability.fine-grained encryption-based &nbsp; access control for big datamohamed nabeel, elisa bertino4cc-8b5.pdfbig data technologies are increasingly used to store and/or analyze personally identifiable information (pii) and other sensitive data. in order to comply with various regulations and organizational policies, such data needs to be stored encrypted and the access to them needs to be controlled based on the identity attributes of users. a simple solution is to use an efficient symmetric key encryption scheme. however, it requires sharing many keys with various entities in the system increasing the risk of key leakage. further, when the user membership changes, these symmetric keys need to be re-issued incurring a high overhead.&nbsp; a better solution is to utilize attribute based encryption (abe) techniques. while abe provides fine-grained access control for encrypted data, they require expensive pairing operations and, further, attribute revocation is inefficient. having identified the strengths and weakness of these solutions, we propose a novel approach using attribute based group key management. unlike the direct application of symmetric key encryption, keys are not stored in the system; they are dynamically derived when data is to be decrypted. our approach is an order of magnitude efficient than the abe based approach as ours is based on symmetric key encryption and broadcast group key management. the main bottleneck in our approach is the key generation operation. we utilize mapreduce framework to improve the performance of the key generation by generating intermediate keys during map phase and generating the final key during the reduce phase. we demonstrate our approach using hadoop, a popular big data platform. the data blocks stored at datanodes are encrypted and public information required to derive the key are stored as part of metadata in the namenode. the encryption is performed at the granularity of hdfs (hadoop distributed file system) blocks. if the group membership changes before appending some new blocks to a file, a new symmetric key and public information are generated to encrypt the new blocks. highlights of our approach are that the symmetric keys are neither stored nor transmitted, and the evolution of encryption is transparent to the clients and the jobtracker which performs mapreduce tasks on clients&#8217; data.impact of henry system of classification on the entropy of fingerprint imagesvandhana chandrasekaran, stephen j elliott, elisa bertino, matt young50e-63f.pdfresearch question &#8211; does fingerprint images classified based on the henry system of fingerprint classification have statistically significant difference in the amount of entropy? this is a follow on study from young (2007).is this hardcopy an original?shriphani palakodety, aravind k. mikkilineni, mikahil atallah, edward j. delpa33-f8e.pdfthis paper deals with the forensic problem of determining whether a document has been scanned and re-printed, as opposed to being the original printout. we consider two cases: (i) the adversary did no deliberate alteration of the contentsof the document between the scanning and the second printing; (ii) the adversary carries out one or more deliberate alterations to the document, such as changing a date, name, or dollar amount. in the latter case, we also want to determine the locations of the alteration(s). we would like the document to inherently carry the evidence of its own originality and ofany illicit alterations that can be carried out. we &#64257;rst presenta framework to determine document originality based on an existing embedding scheme for laser printed documents. we follow up with an adaptation to this framework of techniques from combinatorial group testing.issues in cyber forensicsfrancis ripberger (advisor: dr. marcus rogers)50c-d5d.pdfthis study hopes to identify the issues preventing the cyber forensic field from maintaining validity in its procedures, software, and expert witnesses; in additional to discovering general needs of the field&#8217;s practitioners.every day new issues are discovered; as well as existing issues continue to plague the field.&nbsp; the issues for the field range from simple regulations on how to conduct a forensic procedure, to a lack of certifications, to judicial law shortcomings to properly enforce rules and guidelines.&nbsp; and, as the individuals who are engrossed in the field are aware of one problem or another, many do not know the underlining issues.&nbsp; therefore, research is conducted based on the researcher&#8217;s experience not on the field&#8217;s needs.&nbsp; on the other hand, some have completed research on issues in localized general regions, but no one has performed a national study.this study aims to address these issues.&nbsp; it will ask for volunteers of cyber forensic analysts from each state&#8217;s law enforcement and students and professors from universities that offer a cyber forensic program.&nbsp; all participants will complete a three-round delphi study.&nbsp; from these questions, a list of categorized issues will be generated.&nbsp; in addition, the top five issues in each category, as well as the top ten overall, will be identified.once the results have been properly organized and reviewed, it will be made available for public use.privacy preserving tatonnementjohn ross wallrabenstein, chris clifton0cc-4fa.pdfleon walras&#8217; theory of general equilibrium put forth the notion of tatonnement as a process by which equilibrium prices are determined. recently, cole and fleischer provided tatonnement algorithms for both the classic one-time and ongoing markets with guaranteed bounds for convergence to equilibrium prices.however, in order to reach equilibrium, trade must occur outside of equilibrium prices, which violates the underlying walrasian auction model. we propose a privacy preserving protocol for the one-time market that follows naturally from the algorithms of cole and fleischer, allowing buyers and sellers to jointly compute the equilibrium prices by simulating trade outside of equilibrium. the protocol keeps utility functions of all parties private, revealing only the equilibrium price.finally, we show that our protocol is inherently incentive compatible, such that no party has an incentive to lie about their inputs.privacy through identity managementbharat bhargava192-77e.pdfthe migration of web applications to cloud computing platform has raised concerns about the privacy of sensitive data belonging to the consumers of cloud services. the traditional form of security tokens like username/password used to access cloud services are prone to phishing attacks and hence do not provide complete security. in this work we propose to extend the microsoft&#8217;s cardspace identity management tool, to include more robust security tokens using the zero knowledge proof concept. these security tokens are in the form of saml token supported by windows communication foundation (wcf) and hence can prove interoperable with the existing security platforms.private anonymous messagingruchith fernando, bharat bhargava4b8-28c.pdfwe identify a set of requirements in broadcasting messagesamong a set of untrusted peers connected to an entity. we propose ascheme for those peers to obtain messages of the entity from each other using a pull mechanism where the contacts&#8217; identities are maintained anonymous. we propose a modification to the hierarchical identity based encryption scheme proposed by boneh et. al where a peer can request and obtain messages of a common peer from another peer while remaining anonymous. this scheme further allows changes in group composition using public data.public population information in differential privacychristine task, prof. chris clifton966-32d.pdfprivatized queries which satisfy the strict requirements of differential privacy include randomized noise calibrated to cover up the impact any arbitrary individual could have on the query results.&nbsp; an attacker viewing these results will only be able to learn aggregate information about the data-set, as the noise prevents any single individual from having a detectable effect on the results.&nbsp; not all queries can be effectively privatized in this fashion: if an arbitrary individual could potentially have a very large effect on the results of a query, then the requisite noise may be so large as to eliminate the utility of the results.&nbsp; however, adding sufficient noise to obscure a truly &#8216;arbitrary&#8217; individual is unnecessary if the data-set is sampled from a limited population publicly known to satisfy certain constraints. this is a simple but powerful insight; many queries which are too sensitive to be privatizable in general can be successfully privatized in constrained populations.&nbsp; we prove that reducing noise based on public population information does not weaken privacy, and describe a selection of sensitive queries which become usefully privatizable within constrained populations.query processing in private data outsourcing using anonymizationahmet erhan nergiz, chris clifton9dd-066.pdfwe propose a model supporting privacy-preserving data manipulation for private data outsourcing. this builds on the model of anatomization, where identifying and sensitive information are separated, and linked only in groups such that the probability of a particular sensitive value belonging to a particular individual is below a threshold; the information needed to join the identifying and sensitive information is encrypted with a key known only to the client/data owner. by exposing data where possible, the server can perform value-added services such as data analysis while being unable to violate privacy constraints.we show how data can be queried in this model. the key contribution of this work is a relational query processor that minimizes the client-side computation while ensuring the server learns nothing violating the privacy constraints.resilient and active authentication and user-centric identity ecosystemsyan sui, xukai zoud1d-e54.pdfexisting proxy based authentication approaches have problems(e.g., non-binding, susceptible to theft and dictionary attack, burdenon end-users, re-use risk). biometrics, which authenticates users byintrinsic biological traits, arises to address the drawbacks. however,the biometrics is irreplaceable once compromised and leak sensitiveinformation about the human user behind it. in this research, wepropose a usable, privacy-preserving, secure biometrics based identityverification and protection system. specifically, we propose a novelbiometric authentication token called bio-capsule (bc) which isgenerated by a secure fusion of user biometrics and a (selected)reference subject biometrics. the fusion process preserves thebiometric robustness and accuracy in the sense that the bc can be usedin place of the original user&#8217;s biometric template without sacrificingthe system&#8217;s acceptability for the same user and distinguishabilitybetween different users. there are more potential applications on thisresearch: a user-centric identity ecosystem - a highly resilient,privacy-preserving, revocable, interoperable, and efficientuser-centric identity  verification and protection ecosystem; and anactive authentication system - a provably secure, privacy-preserving,biometric active authentication system to support continuous andnon-intrusive authentication.rfid applications of embedded processing and zero-knowledge proofrobert winkworthd61-d44.pdfradio frequency identification has enabled exciting new prospects in wireless id services, particularly for personnel.&nbsp; unfortunately, the earliest applications relied upon acquiescent mechanisms that accepted and returned data with no intermediary processing.&nbsp; the advent of &#8220;smart&#8221; cards made possible an on-chip revolution in the use of contact identification devices.&nbsp; what i explore here is the extension of these embedded systems to their non-contact counterparts (namely rfid).&nbsp; the processing layer is of utmost importance to us in the study of privacy controls, as it opens the discussion on how personnel id in general may evolve from storage devices that may be intercepted and duplicated into cryptographically sound logic devices that can resist common attacks and directly participate in the decisions concerning disclosure.&nbsp; this brings us to one of the most vital aspects of the research, the zero-knowledge proof.&nbsp; frequently rfid is applied as a convenient means of answering questions about discrete state (from a comfortable distance).&nbsp; wherever possible, we wish to answer those questions without compromising user privacy in the process.&nbsp; the integration of rfid and embedded systems allows us to perform proofs based on internal comparisons and calculations rather than irrevocable release of the data.&nbsp; this is the security of the embedded systems used widely in electronic commerce with the convenience of near-field communications.&nbsp; it holds the promise of a better all-around user experience, with better protections, more control, and easier methods of performing common objectives.trust, empathy, social identity, and contribution of knowledge within patient online communitiesjing zhao, ph.d.1, kathleen abrahamson, ph.d., rn2, 1department of consumer sciences and retailing, purdue university, west lafayette, in 47907276-91d.pdfobjectives: with the development of internet technology, more and more people utilize patient online communities (poc) to seek useful health information and empathetic support. pocs are a unique type of virtual communityies and have attracted increasing research interest.&nbsp; although there are critical factors for developing and maintaining a successful poc, few studies examine the influence of trust, empathy, and social identity on members&#8217; contribution of information and knowledge within the poc context. we aim to examine how trust and social identity influence empathy, which in turn motivates individuals to contribute knowledge within poc and how social identity also directly affects poc members&#8217; knowledge contribution.design: this study examines the impacts of trust and social identity on knowledge contribution through the mediation effect of empathy. the direct relationship between social identity and knowledge contribution is also studiedincluded in this model.measurements: an online survey was conducted in three health related online communities. a confirmatory factor analysis was perrformedperformed and a structural equation modeling was constructed  toconstructed to test the proposed model.results: results indicate that trust and the development of a sense of social identity within the community are necessary antecedents to the development of empathy, which in turn influences members&#8217; willingness to contribute personal knowledge and experience. or information.&nbsp; social social identity also directly motivates members&#8217; to contribute knowledge. in contrast to other studies that have emphasized threthe importance of providing tools that make information seeking more efficient, the ffindings of our study  highlight the importance of trust, empathy and a sense of group cohesiveness within online health settings that motivzatemotivates members to contribute knowledge and support to other participants in the poc.understanding malware through classification and machine learningcory q. nguyen, rui m. esteves, dr. thomas j. hacker, dr. j. eric dietz835-75b.pdfthis study applies the concepts of machine learning and techniques of classification to help us better understand malware and its behavior and developing trends. in studying it&#8217;s behavior and characteristic , not only do we have a better understanding of what an unknown malware does and what its purpose is, but also a better idea of how to respond to the threat. it is important to accurately classify and identify unknown malware to reduce the response time.currently, our lab has collected a total of 579,342 samples with 74,191 unique samples. these samples are processed through an automated analysis engine which outputs reports where are then refined, formatted, and indexed into a central database. once the raw data is uploaded. specific attributes are selected to be processed for descriptive and predictive modeling.we have used clustering algorithms, specifically, a mixture of partitional and hierarchical clustering, however, our attribute list continue to grow by n-dimension. thus, we are currently accessing how to shorten our attribute list. previously our attribute list was composed of more than 59,000 attributes. recently, we shortened the list to 23 attributes, however, the accuracy and feasibility of these 23 attributes have yet to be evaluated.end system securitygatling: automatic attack discovery in large-scale distributed systemshyojeong lee, jeff seibert, charles killian and cristina nita-rotaru59f-360.pdfin this paper, we propose gatling, a framework that au- tomatically finds performance attacks caused by insider at- tackers in large-scale message-passing distributed systems. in performance attacks, malicious nodes deviate from the protocol when sending or creating messages, with the goal of degrading system performance. we identify a represen- tative set of basic malicious message delivery and lying ac- tions and design a greedy search algorithm that finds effec- tive attacks consisting of a subset of these actions. while lying malicious actions are protocol dependent, requiring the format and meaning of messages, gatling captures them without needing to modify the target system, by using a type- aware compiler. we have implemented and used gatling on six systems, a virtual coordinate system, a distributed hash table lookup service and application, two multicast systems and one file sharing application, and found a total of 41 attacks, ranging from a few minutes to a few hours to find each attack.motivation of pharmacies to use biometric authenticationdr. stephen elliott56d-c9c.pdfthe purpose of this research is to survey and interview pharmacists who had experienced biometricauthenticators in a pharmacy setting and those who have not, to answer the question, &#8220;why would pharmacistshighly consider using traditional authentication systems than biometric systems despite the security issue ofmemorability?&#8221; understanding the pharmacists&#8217; thoughts, motivations, influences, decisions, and attitudes ofusing biometric systems may identify possible variables to develop a theory.process implanting: a new active introspection framework for virtualizationzhongshu gu, zhui deng, dongyan xu, xuxian jiang577-c5f.pdfprevious research on virtual machine introspection proposed &#8220;out-of-box&#8221; approach by moving out securitytools from the guest operating system. however, compared tothe traditional &#8220;in-the-box&#8221; approach, it remains a challengeto obtain a complete semantic view due to the semantic gapbetween the guest vm and the hypervisor.in this paper, we present process implanting, a new activevm introspection framework, to narrow the semantic gap byimplanting a process from the host into the guest vm andexecuting it under the cover of an existing running process.with the protection and coordination from the hypervisor,the implanted process can run with a degree of stealthinessand exit gracefully without leaving negative impact on theguest operating system. we have designed and implemented aproof-of-concept prototype on kvm which leverages hardwarevirtualization. we also propose and demonstrate applicationscenarios for process implanting in the area of vm securityhuman centric securitynl ias marches onv. raskin, j. m. taylor408-4be.pdfnatural language processing (nlp) has many applications for information assurance and security (ias). we present a walkthrough of the analysis of nl texts by ontological semantic technology, using an example that exhibits multiple forms of ambiguity.secure communication among robots and humans with a human voiceji hyeon hong, julia taylor, eric matson, victor raskina6e-f68.pdfas firefighting situations are urgent, the demand of firefighting robots communicating with a human in a natural language is increasing as it is efficient in that there is no need an commander to get trained for operating a controller. however, when communicating with a human in a natural language, there is an issue regarding security; firefighting robots are supposed to operate according to commands by an authorized commander, it is difficult that firefighting robots verify authentication with a human voice. however, it is still important to keep the communication between a human (a commander, not an adversary) and a firefighting robot secure due to any potential situation of a person setting fire on purpose and wanting to hinder firefighting tasks. thus, i am currently researching to realize a secure and accurate communication in a human language.social group and identity management across social networking sitesgeovon boisvenue5aa-27f.pdfthis poster presents findings of a research study that uses in-depth qualitative interviewing to identify the strategies social media users employ to manage their online identity (self-presentation) and various social groups. this research project is supported by verisign co.trust framework for social networksarjan durresi291-153.pdfwe are developing a trust framework for social networks. theframework includes new metrics for trust evaluation and itsconfidence. we consider trust assessments similar to physicalmeasurements. therefore, we apply measurement theory of errors intrust evaluation. we have tested our framework with real datasets fromsocial networks. our results confirm the validity of our approach.furthermore, we show some great advantages of our framework, forexample the trust view in an experiment was increased more than 2000times. our framework can be used to build security mechanisms forsocial networks, including filters against ddos and untrustedinformation, detection of cliques of attackers and much more.network securitycreate moving target defense in static networks by learning from botnetsfeng li, iupui;&nbsp; xukai zou, iupui; wei peng, iupui159-98e.pdfnetwork disruptive attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (ddos) attacks, routing attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks, are a major impediment in the development of networks. the static nature of network configuration enables adversaries attack these networks to effectively discover and disrupt network resources remotely.&nbsp; similar to network disruptive threats, the root of many security threats is the static or relatively stable status of the system, which can be easily exploited by attackers. a recent census regarding the game-changing theme of cyber security leads us to moving target defense (mtd). the mtd aims to change the uneven cost between attackers and defenders caused by the static systems. unfortunately, what to do and how to do it currently are not clear for mtd in network systems, even though there are several recent innovative security research attempts on host and software dynamics to increase the cost of the attacker.&nbsp; thus, this project will address this new, yet challenging, issue of mtd in the static network systems.although the research on mtd in static networks is in its infant stage, the attackers have actually accumulated valuable experiences and ideas in this area. the history of the botnet, which is a collection of compromised nodes (computers, which are also known as bots) connected through a network, vividly represents the evolution from static to `moving&#8217; networks. therefore, this project starts with a thorough investigation on the moving techniques used in the recent botnets. the objective of this research is to design an innovative moving target defense framework that will improve resiliency and harden existing static networks by learning from recent botnets. this framework will make the static network move to the disadvantage of the attackers, by increasing an attacker&#8217;s uncertainty, difficulty, and cost in the network disruptive attacks.multi-path overlay routing to improve latency while tolerating intrusionsandrew newell, endadul hoque, and cristina nita-rotaruc74-069.pdfmany online services require better latency guarantees than offered by the general internet infrastucture, and previous work has shown this is achievable with overlay networks. we consider mission-critical network services which need to maintain these latency guarantees despite outages or intrusions of overlay nodes. our approach is to route data along multiple node-disjoint paths to ensure data delivery along at least one path. we consider a new routing problem which optimizes the worst path out of a set of chosen paths which are node-disjoint. we formulate a mixed integer program to solve this optimization problem, and we experiment on a real-world dataset to test the feasibility of our solution.newton meets vivaldi: securing virtual coordinates by enforcing physical lawsjeff seibert, sheila becker, cristina nita-rotaru, radu stateced-acb.pdfvirtual coordinate systems (vcs) provide accurateestimations of latency between arbitrary hosts on a network,while conducting a small amount of actual measurements andrelying on node cooperation. while these systems have goodaccuracy under benign settings, they suffer a severe decreaseof their effectiveness when under attack by compromised nodesacting as insider attackers. previous defenses mitigate suchattacks by using machine learning techniques to differentiategood behavior (learned over time) from bad behavior. however,these defense schemes have been shown to be vulnerable toadvanced attacks that make the schemes learn malicious behavioras good behavior.we present newton, a decentralized vcs that is robust toa wide class of insider attacks. newton uses an abstraction ofa real-life physical system, similar to that of vivaldi, but inaddition uses safety invariants derived from newton&#8217;s laws ofmotion. as a result, newton does not need to learn good behaviorand can tolerate a significantly higher percentage of maliciousnodes. we show through simulations and real-world experimentson the planetlab testbed that newton is able to mitigate allknown attacks against vcs while providing better accuracy thanvivaldi, even in benign settings.over-the-air penetration testingeric katz, bryan lee, richard mislan827-b9d.pdfthe purpose of this study is to determine whether it is possible to penetrate a mobile device from another device that is on the same cellular network. the study will concentrate on the android platform and focus on attempts to penetrate the most popular applications for the platform. for this study, we will be testing some of the top free android play store applications, such as facebook for android and skype for android. the purpose will be to see if it is possible to gather pertinent information ranging from contacts and messages to a full forensic image of the device from the target. previous research in this area has involved man-in-the-middle techniques that require the target device to connect to hardware controlled by the attacker, which then forwards the information to the cellular network. this means that special equipment and the target phone are required in order to carry out the attack. if a mobile-to-mobile attack is possible, all that is needed is a phone that is able to connect to the network the target is on and any scripts and software created for the exploit. this could be a very useful technique in areas where pertinent information is passed over cellular networks, such as a drug trafficking ring or terrorist cell.privacy-preserving and ef&#64257;cient friend recommendation in social networksbharath k. samanthula,&nbsp;  lei cen,&nbsp; wei jiang,&nbsp; luo si77e-936.pdffriend recommendation is a well-known application in many social networks and has been studied extensively in the recent past.however, with the growing concerns about users&#8217; privacy, there is a strong need to develop privacy preserving friend recommendation methods for social networks.&nbsp; in this paper, we propose two novel methods to recommend friends for a given user by using the common neighbors proximity measure in a privacy preserving manner. the &#64257;rst method is based on the properties of additive homomorphic encryption scheme and also utilizes a universal hash function for ef&#64257;ciency purpose.&nbsp; the second method utilizes the concept of protecting the source privacy through randomizing themessage passing path and recommends friends accurately. in addition, we empirically compare the ef&#64257;ciency and accuracy of the two methods. the proposed protocols act as a trade-off among security,accuracy, and ef&#64257;ciency; thus, users can choose between these twoprotocols depending on the application requirements.resource mapping on hybrid testbedswei-min yao, jiahongzhu, sonia fahmy46c-991.pdfthe integration of real hardware and systems increases the fidelity of a testbed, but limits its scalability. scaling techniques, such as virtualization and real-time simulation, can increase the scale of experiments conducted on the testbed. manual mapping of the experimental scenario onto thetestbed resources and scaling techniques is intractable for large experiments.we propose a method to automatically map testbed resources according to user-specified requirements. our mechanism identifies suitable scaling techniques for parts of the input experimental topology and adjusts their resource requirements according to the goal of the experiment. new network features can be easily incorporated to support a wide diversity of network experiments and testbed resources.secure configuration of intrusion detection sensors for changing enterprise systemsgaspar modelo-howard, jevin sweval, saurabh bagchib9a-545.pdfcurrent attacks to distributed systems involve multiple steps, due to attackers usually taking multiple actions to achieve their goals. such attacks are called multi-stage attacks (msa) and have the ultimate goal to compromise a critical asset for the victim. an example would be compromising a web server, then achieve a series of intermediary steps (such as compromising a developer&#8217;s box thanks to a vulnerable php module and connecting to a ftp server with gained credentials) to ultimately connect to a database where user credentials are stored. current detection systems are not capable of analyzing the multi-step attack scenario.we present a distributed detection framework based on a probabilistic reasoning engine that communicates to detection sensors and can achieve two goals: (1) protect the critical asset by detecting msas and (2) tune sensors according to the changing environment of the distributed system monitored by the distributed framework. as shown in the experiments, the framework reduces the number of false positives that it would otherwise report if it were only considering alerts from a single detector and the recon&#64257;guration of sensors allows the framework to detect attacks that take advantage of the changing system environment.securing application-level topology estimation networks: facing the frog-boiling attackjeff seibert, cristina nita-rotaru, radu statecad-d4e.pdfpeer-to-peer real-time communication and media streaming applications optimize their performance by using application-level topology estimation services suchas virtual coordinate systems. virtual coordinate systems allow nodes ina peer-to-peer network to accurately predict latency between arbitrary nodeswithout the need of performing extensive measurements. however, systems that leverage virtual coordinates as supporting building blocks, are prone to attacks conducted by compromised nodes that aim at disrupting, eavesdropping,or mangling with the underlying communications.recent research proposed techniques to mitigate basic attacks (inflation,deflation, oscillation) considering a single attack strategy model whereattackers perform only one type of attack. in this work we explore supervisedmachine learning techniques to mitigate more subtle yet highly effectiveattacks (frog-boiling, network-partition) that are able to bypassexisting defenses. we evaluate our techniques on the vivaldi system against a more complex attackstrategy model, where attackers perform sequences of all known attacks againstvirtual coordinate systems, using both simulations and internet deployments.securing

problemssimulation of data transmission in network environmentdi jin00d-770.pdflast two decades have witnessed the development of internet. it is deniable that internet shortened the distance among people. however, the requirement of data transmission various from situations. my study is inspired by the data transmission in the metro system. in such situation, there are two kinds of signals: one is control signal and the other is video signal. for the first one, the amount of data is small, but the accuracy must be guaranteed. for the second one, data loss is allowed, but the transimitting speed must be large enough to ensure video transmission.my project tries to simulate data transmission which can be further implemented in secure communication situation.t-dominance: a stealthy propagation strategy for mobile botnetwei peng, feng li, xukai zou (@ iupui), jie wu (@temple university)0eb-5b5.pdfsmartphone-based mobile computing is emerging as a preferred computing platform of the future.&nbsp; mobile botnet, which has deep roots in traditional internet botnet and exploits  unique characteristics of mobile computing in propagation, is an imminent security threat to the emerging computing platform. in the spirit of ``forewarned is forearmed&#8217;&#8216;, we play devil&#8217;s advocate by proposing techniques that mobile botnets might use to circumvent defense.&nbsp; the key ideas of our work are a novel concept of stealthy botnet and the distinct strategies used in two consecutive phases, herding and attack, in the lifetime of a stealthy botnet.&nbsp; a few points distinguish our research in the context of previous works. 1) based on proximity malware propagation, we propose the concept of botnet-level stealthiness and a novel structural property, t-dominance, for a mobile botnet; the t-dominance property is defined upon mobility and social pattern of smartphone users. 2) we design a distributed algorithm which maintains the t-dominance structural property for a mobile botnet; the algorithm is localized and delay-tolerant in the sense that it maintains the structural property based solely on local and potentially outdated information.policy, law and managementamazon kindle forensicsmarcus thompson78e-4d3.pdfthe amazon kindle is becoming an increasingly popular e-book reader. this examination of the kindle keyboard is

the unstructured domain of cyber warfare knowledge a specific model will allow experts to produce a concept map significantly more detailed than absent the model.&#8221; experts were solicited in a variety of venues to map cyber warfare using a concept mapping process and provide a deeper understanding of the concept. two technology-centric models were given to groups of experts to assist them in explaining elements of cyber conflict. one group was just given the cyber warfare question and no specific model as guidance. the groups were then compared to see if either of the models had better explanatory power per the experts responses.identity policy choices as propagation of structurem. dark216-7ca.pdfthe debate over how identifying information is used online has a focus in the decisions over identity policies employed in online communities. the now-common decision&#8212;between anonymous, pseudonymous, and &#8220;real name&#8221; handles&#8212;has implications for interaction not only within the community in question but outside of it. we explore these in a framework for the explanation of how individual decisions form and are formed by existing social structures.minding our

luo side7-fbd.pdfmasquerade attack is a serious computer security problem,which can cause significant damage. many previous researchworks were based on two-class training that collected datafrom multiple users to train one self (i.e., regular) model andone non-self (i.e., abnormal) model for each user. two-classlearning methods for masquerade detection can generate accurateresults but demand data from all users, which maynot be available for many practical applications. on the otherside, one-class learning methods build a model for eachuser by utilizing only his/her own data. one-class learningmethods are more practical but they also suffer fromthe limited amount of training information from a single user.to address the data sparsity issue, we propose a robustone-class bayesian approach for masquerade detection. thenew method explicitly considers model uncertainty by integratingout the unknown model parameters for generatingrobust results, while previous one-class methods only use asingle point estimate to find an optimal model. we derivethe full analytical solution of the predictive distribution overall possible model parameters. a set of experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms mostprevious one-class approach for masquerade detection.closing the pandora&#8217;s box: defenses for thwarting epidemic  outbreaks in mobile adhoc networksrahul potharaju, endadul hoque, cristina nita-rotaru, saswati sarkar, santosh s. venkatesh544-4ba.pdfwith the advent of google&#8217;s android, the world has observed a dramatic increase in the number of wireless devices with complex capabilities and supporting open source oses. while the openness of oses induces developers&#8217; motivation, it also introduces a new propagation vector for mobile malware. in this paper, we model the propagation of mobile malware using theory of epidemiology and study the problem as a function of the underlying mobility models. we define the optimal approach to heal an infected system with a set of static-healers as the t-cover problem and show that it is np-hard. we then propose two families of healer protocols - a time-optimized randomized version that is simple to implement and an energy-optimized profile-based version that enables a healer to &#8220;learn&#8221; about its proximity to make better decisions. we show through extensive simulations using the ns-3 simulator that despite lacking knowledge of the future, our healer-based protocols show reasonable performance when compared to an oracle-based solution.co-tenant application security on mobile devicespelin angin, bharat bhargavace5-3c6.pdfthe proliferation of mobile devices has made them increasingly exposed to security risks, with attackers shifting their targets towards these due to their increased use in daily life. this work focuses on the security risks current mobile device architectures are prone to in terms of leakage of sensitive information due to multiple applications sharing the same resources (i.e. application co-tenancy). in this work, we propose a virtualization-based approach to isolate security-critical applications from others running on the same mobile device. the proposed approach for isolating applications is based on running security critical applications in their own virtual machines, which allows for separation of the data space of these from that of other applications on the same device.computer forensics at nistdr. paul black, dr. james lyle, mr. douglas whitece3-76d.pdfan introduction to three computer forensics

there is a greater need to access the data stored on them. certain tools, such as the cellebrite ufed and the susteen datapilot, claim to have universal data collecting ability. data state supposedly does not matter to these devices. the manufacturers assert normal, hidden, or deleted content can be extracted. we intend to test these claims by using data hiding techniques common to computers and evaluating the results.finding the story in the tweetstack: mining spatio-temporal clusters for event correlation and visualizationrahul potharaju, andrew newell, cristina nita-rotaru5aa-2e8.pdfin recent years, social media activity has reached unprecendented levels. hundreds of millions of users now participate in online social networks and forums, subscribe to microblogging services or maintain blogs. twitter, in particular, is currently the major microblogging service, with more than 175 million subscribers. twitter users generate short text messages, called tweets, to report their current thoughts and actions, comment on breaking news and engage in discussions. this work presents time series based clustering of real-time stream data as a pre-cursor to applying sophisticated natural language processing or machine learning techniques. first, we show that for entities related in the physical world, even without the aid of heavy natural language processing techniques, we can cluster them together merely based on the structure of their timelines. second, by converting the inherent timeline structure into a symbolic representation, we intend to cluster time series of different words to obtain an initial set of clusters that can then be analyzed further using alternate techniques.insider threat mitigation frameworkvictor raskin, melissa j. dark, simon slobodnik259-dba.pdfin military cyber operations, mission oriented risk design analysis (morda) (buckshaw et al 2005)&nbsp; is used to carry out risk assessment of adversary action.&nbsp; morda has been used in operations since 1999 in various missions.&nbsp; it is a systemic and comprehensive model for risk, vulnerability and cost assessment.&nbsp;methodology of such scope is lacking in the world of insider threat mitigation.&nbsp; mechanisms exist to detect and sometimes predict insider threat.&nbsp; however models and the scope of morda are not used with insider threat in mind.events that lead to an insider becoming malicious are rarely viewed as deterministic because full information is not available for computation.&nbsp; therefore identifying an individual as &#8220;high risk&#8221; in terms malicious activity has historically fallen to humans rather than any automated system.morda in conjunction with a reasoner that is based on a  dynamic bayesian network (dbn) as used by greitzer et al (2009), and bishop&#8217;s et al (2010) unifying policy hierarchy to be used to evaluate malicious insider threat comprehensively.&nbsp;this approach assures a systemic approach to evaluating impact of adversary action, specifically that of a malicious insider.&nbsp; a systemic, approach with costs attached will allow to address the issue of a malicious insider from a business as well as security viewpoint.&nbsp; this will contribute to insider threat detection and prevention mechanisms rather than &#8220;after-the-fact&#8221; response.modeling  and simulating  the

organizations and its subsidiaries.&nbsp; the model&#8217;s purpose is to measure both direct and indirect cost and impact of a given malware.&nbsp; currently, a model of campus is being developed.given the ability to visualize and  reasonably assess the impact of  a given malware and the potential cost incurred, organizations can have a better grasp of  its current ability to prevent, address, and mitigate future potential threats. additionally, it would have a more clearer picture of future implementations and action items needed to manage the risk responsibly.&nbsp; simply, with the ability to model and simulate a given malware threat of a specific organization gives knowledge and insight to develop a thorough  and reliable risk management system.secure sensor network sum aggregation with detection of malicious nodessunoh choi, gabriel ghinita, and elisa bertinob6d-17d.pdfin-network aggregation is an essential operation which reduces communication overhead and power consumption of resource-constrained sensor network nodes. sensor nodes are typically organized into an aggregation tree, whereby aggregator nodes collect data from multiple data source nodes, and perform a reduction operation such as sum, average, minimum, etc. the result is then forwarded to other aggregators higher in the hierarchy toward a base station (or sink node) that receives the final outcome of the in-network computation. however, despite its performance benefits, aggregation introduces several difficult security challenges with respect to data confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. in today&#8217;s outsource-centric computing environments, the aggregation task may be delegated to a third party that is not fully trusted. in addition, even in the absence of outsourcing, nodes may be compromised by a malicious adversary with the purpose of altering aggregation results.to defend against such threats, several mechanisms have been proposed, most of which devise aggregation schemes that rely on cryptography to detect that an attack has occurred. although they prevent the sink from accepting an incorrect result, such techniques are vulnerable to denial-of-service if a compromised node alters the aggregation result in each round. several more recent approaches also identify the malicious nodes and exclude them from future computation rounds. however, these incur high communication overhead as they require flooding or other expensive communication models to connect individual nodes with the base station. we propose a flexible aggregation structure (fas) and an advanced ring structure (ars) topology that allow secure aggregation and efficient identification of malicious aggregator nodes for the sum operation. our scheme uses only symmetric key cryptography, outperforms existing solutions in terms of performance, and guarantees that the aggregate result is correct and that malicious nodes are identified.security auditing in service oriented architecturem. azarmi , p. angin, b. bhargava, n. ahmed , a. sinclair0b6-e42.pdfservice oriented architectures (soa) introduce new security challenges not present in the single-hop client-server architectures due to the involvement in multiple service providers  in a service request. considering the additional security threats on soas, the interactions of independent service domains could violate service policies or slas.&nbsp; we provide an efficient solution for auditing service invocations in soa. this solution is transparent to the services, which allows using legacy services without modification. moreover, we are investigating the transition to the cloud computing.the evolution of agricultural pest control and food securitylisa liuee1-ae3.pdffood security is one of the critical issues in homeland security. just as the infrastructure, electric grid, or internet, it is the primary responsibility of homeland security authorities to protect the food we grow from any eventuality that will hurt the consumer, be it a direct act of contamination or an unintended side effect of a production practice. this research deals with the latter in a long-term historical aspect, demonstrating that protective measures must be undertaken now to prevent considerable damage to food supply later.trustworthy data from untrusted databasesrohit jain, sunil prabhakar2fa-b6d.pdfensuring the trustworthiness of data retrieved from a database is of utmost importance to users.&nbsp; the correctness of data stored in a database is defined by the faithful execution of only valid (authorized) transactions. in this paper we address the question of whether it is necessary to trust a database server in order to trust the data retrieved from it. the lack of trust arises naturally if the database server is owned by a third party, as in the case of cloud computing. it also arises if the server may have been compromised, or there is a malicious insider. in particular, we reduce the level of trust necessary in order to establish the authenticity and integrity of data at an untrusted server. earlier work on this problem is limited to situations where there are no updates to the database, or all updates are authorized and vetted by a central trusted entity. this is an unreasonable assumption for a truly dynamic database, as would be expected in many business applications, where multiple clients can update data without having to check with a central server that approves of their changes.we identify the problem of ensuring trustworthiness of data on an untrusted server in the presence of transactional updates that run directly on the database, and develop the first solutions to this problem. our solutions also provide indemnity foran honest server and assured provenance for all updates to the data. we implement our solution in a prototype system built on top of oracle with nomodifications to the database internals. we also provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed solutions and establish their feasibility.unmanned aerial systems cyberattack identification and analysisjames goppert, andrew shull, inseok hwang2b4-35e.pdfunmanned aerial vehicles have taken on a very large role in military operations and there is considerable interest in expanding their use to commercial and scientific applications. because of the dependence of these vehicles on computer systems, their high degree of autonomy, and the danger posed by a loss of vehicle control, it is critical that the proliferation of these vehicles be accompanied by a thorough analysis of their vulnerabilities to cyberattack.end contentleft divcurrent newsprivacy, battery life cost of free apps, experts sayspafford wins award for

textbibtexrefworks procite/refman&#x00a0;download content&#x00a0;download pdfpdfs requireadobe acrobat&#x00a0;security applications are a point where machine learning and game theory naturally meet. this is true especially in contexts            where some learning from data occurs, whose source may be adversarial, or where decision making involves interactions between            multiple agents.part of this special issue deals with principled approaches to security problems, which employ learning or game theory. this            involves problems in adversarial learning, learning in distributed settings, privacy issues of learning, or games with partial            information. this issue is quite timely, for three reasons. firstly, there has been a significant amount of recent work on            learning approaches for game-theory. at the same time, game theory has been employed in a number of learning contexts, especially            in adversarial learning and multiagent reinforcement learning. finally, privacy issues related to data mining are also of            high importance, due to the collection of data by numerous organisations. the strong interconnections between machine learning,            cryptography and game theory, become apparent in the papers contained in this issue.half of the papers in this special issue deal with privacy preservation. the first paper, &#x201c;incentive compatible privacy-preserving            distributed classification,&#x201d; by robert nix and murat kantarcioglu, focuses on the problem of distributed data mining,            where agents are required to be truthful, but where verification would violate privacy. in order to tackle this problem they            employ game theoretic mechanism design to encourage agents to be truthful. the second paper, &#x201c;large margin gaussian            mixture models with differential privacy,&#x201d; by manas a. pathak and bhiksha raj, deals with the problem of privacy-preserving            classification, using a gaussian mixture model. they show, both experimentally and theoretically, that their solution leads            to good privacy guarantees with a very small performance loss relative to a classifier that has does not preserve privacy.            finally, &#x201c;on privacy of encrypted speech communications,&#x201d; by ye zhu, yuanchao lu, and anil vikram, shows            that a seemingly innocuous feature of internet speech communication, silence suppression, can lead to privacy leakage through            the revelation of speech patterns.the remaining papers deal with security issues, and in particular with detection and responses to intrusion. the paper by            adam barth, benjamin i.p. rubinstein, mukund sundararajan, john c. mitchell, dawn song, and peter l. bartlett, &#x201c;a            learning-based approach to reactive security,&#x201d; presents a generalised model of a security system which learns from            experience to optimally allocate resources for counteracting future attacks. assuming that the attacker's payoffs are unknown,            but previous attacks are revealed, they prove that their algorithm performs nearly as well as the best fixed proactive strategy.            the paper by jun-won ho, matthew wright, and sajal k. das, &#x201c;zonetrust: fast zone-based node compromise detection            and revocation in wireless sensor networks using sequential hypothesis testing,&#x201d; deals with the problem of detecting            compromised nodes in wireless sensor networks. using the classic technique of sequential hypothesis testing, they are able            to efficiently identify and remove suspect nodes in an online setting. theoretically, they show that their strategy effectively            bounds the attacker's gain in their setting. finally, &#x201c;doubleguard: detecting intrusions in multitier web applications,&#x201d;            by meixing le, angelos stavrou, and brent byunghoon kang, describes an intrusion detection system in a web application. they            experimentally show that, with a small performance overhead, they are able to very effectively detect intrusions, while achieving            very small false positive rates.overall, we believe that this issue has achieved its primary purpose of collecting state-of-the-art research at the intersection            of learning, games and security. the papers contained in this issue not only represent important theoretical advances, which            offer opportunities for further research, but also describe interesting and effective applications in real domains.christos dimitrakakistom karygianniskaterina mitrokotsaguest editors&#x2022;c. dimitrakakis is with lia,

oxford recognition ltdtel: +44 (0) 7763147420email:info@oxreco.combrief historyskin cancer screening system solutionsbrief historydr. d. dubovitskiy the company director of oxford recognition ltd is an expert in artificial intelligence, machine vision and pattern recognition. his work has involved hardware and software engineering, system design, mathematical modeling, image processing, digital filtering, and digital signal processing algorithm construction. the company has developed ai systems comprising data acquisition modules, adsp, embedded software, pc controllers, system drivers, graphical user interfaces and data storage systems. the company has considerable experience in project management, technology transfer and in the practical implementation of scientific and technological results.the company has seven years of experience in digital image processing. since 2000 we have been designing and developing software and hardware solutions for a variety of different applications. we have created surface inspection systems for an iron and steel corporation, an early cancer detection system for medical imaging, image enhancement algorithms, a digital watermarking process for audio and video information and a security application with independent protected core functioning.for our first project we designed a defect recognition and analysis system for an iron and steel corporation. this project used line scan cameras for scanning moving metal strips which were moving at a speed of up to 6 m/sec. the detector hardware then highlighted regions of interest and the analytic software made a decision about particular object.our second research and development project involved the design of a medical imaging system in order to screen and recognize abnormal biological cells in cervical smear test samples. the system used microscopy with a motorized table. the sample was prepared by the papanicolau method and then automatically scanned by a microscope which was capable of making a decision on whether the disease was present.another similar application of the cervical smear diagnosis algorithm was in skin cancer detection. this project focused on the use of the algorithm by gp doctors for evaluation of suspicious birth-marks or moles found on patients. the image acquisition was performed with a nikon dermatology lens adapter and the structure recognition descriptors were designed in this case to push the decision making engine to make an optimal-probabilistic conclusion for particular skin conditions.most recently we have been working on several small projects involving image enhancement systems. the most significant of these is the correspondence point matching, stereo reconstruction procedure project in which an eye tracking device is currently under development thanks to financial support from the eu.our third major project has produced significant developments in the areas of hardware - a usb mass storage device designed for security applications will allow users to have independent control of data which has been saved on it.the forth active division involves specially designed digital watermarking algorithms for adding digital seal information or owner specific data to pictures or audio files. this approach allows users to add small quantities of extra data to a media file. the most interesting feature of the given solution is that information can be recovered even after reasonable compression or passing through a noise channel.the company is actively engaged in applying the image processing techniques we have developed in the image processing field. in addition we have our own technology in digital fractal geometry and a fuzzy logic system for autonomous object recognition activity. it is involved in special learning procedures in the structural analysis and navigation field.  several 2d binary original operators have been discovered and the intellectual property rights have been published.activitiesthe company develops image processing, object recognition technology algorithms which has been designed for independent operation systems in natural environment without human involvement.2009 oxford recognition ltd. tel: +44 (0) 7763147420 | email:info@oxreco.com

of the object to be recognized.descriptiondescription:this invention relates generally to photomeasuring devices and, more particularly, to a new and improved photomeasuring apparatus for producing digital representations of objects for use in conjunction with computer storage systems and the like for object recognition.generally speaking, the present invention is directed toward a method and apparatus for assigning a coded set of values to an object being studied, which code may be transferred to a computer storage system for future reference and comparison with coded values of similar objects. more particularly, the present invention is directed toward a new and improved method and apparatus for analyzing an object by dividing a projected image of the object into a series of successively arranged narrow elongated areas, each of which is assigned a coded value proportional to the relative overall density thereof. this set of coded values is then transmitted to a suitable computer storage or memory system in a particular ordered form of serial density values. at such time as an unknown object is studied, the density values of the unknown object which is obtained in an identical manner is compared with the values of the known object, the particular computer being programmed for maximum or minimum leniency or deviation from the density values of the known object so that if the values of the unknown object falls within the limitations of the program, the computer would then "recognize" the unknown object for purposes of evaluation, storage or the like. the particular computer can be adjusted such that the deviation or leniency of the program may be varied considerably so that the density values of a multiplicity of unknown objects will fall within the general category or class of values of the known object.it is a general object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus of the above character wherein the serial density of values assigned to and representative of the density of a multiplicity of object elements remains completely linear.it is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method and apparatus of the above character which is adapted to accurately analyze and code an object in a minimum period of time.it is still another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method and apparatus of the above character which comprises readily available components and is therefore economical to commercially manufacture.it is still another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus of the above character which is extremely compact in size and is therefore easy to handle and transport.it is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus of the above character which is adapted to analyze and code photographic transparencies which are either in color or in black and white.it is yet another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method and apparatus of the above character which will accommodate transparencies of various sizes.it is still a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method and apparatus of the above character which will accommodate opaque media (photos, drawings, actual objects) and also projected images from microscopes, etc.in accordance with the invention, a light image of an object to be recognized is scanned in a series of narrow elongated laterally displaced parallel areas. photoelectric means responds to the overall light from successive narrow elongated areas and produces corresponding signals. these signals are converted to corresponding digital values. the resultant digital representation of the object may be compared by a computer with digital representations of other objects obtained in the same manner to determine whether they are like or unlike.inasmuch as only a moderate number of digits are required to represent the object, comparison is greatly facilitated and useful results obtained.in the specific embodiment described hereinafter an image of the object is projected onto a display screen. a mask having a narrow elongated slit is positioned between the display screen and the photoelectric means. the mask and light image are relatively movable in a direction lateral to the length of the slit so that light passing through the slit to the photoelectric means corresponds successively to successive narrow elongated areas of the light image. the photoelectric means responds to the overall light passing through the slit in each position thereof, so that its output and the corresponding digital values represent variations in the overall light through the slit as it scans across the light image. the movement of the slit relative to the light image may be incremented in steps approximately equal to the width of the slit.other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:fig. 1 is a top elevational view of an exemplary embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention; andfig. 2 is a side elevational view of the apparatus illustrated in fig. 1.referring now to figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings, a photomeasuring device or apparatus 10, in accordance with an exemplary construction of the present invention, is shown as comprising four modes or sections, namely, an image or pattern producing mode 12, an image or pattern conveying mode 14, a photomeasuring mode 16 and a data recording mode 18. the mode or section 12 is adapted to produce a light image or pattern of the object being analyzed by the apparatus 10, which image or pattern is conveyed through the mode 14 to the photomeasuring mode 16. the projected pattern or image is then analyzed by a light sensitive mechanism which produces a series of electrical signals in accordance with the density pattern of the image. these signals are then converted into a form suitable to be stored in a computer memory system for future reference, as will hereinafter be described.referring now in detail to the image or pattern producing mode 12, there is provided an image producing mechanism 20 which may be in the form of a photographic slide projector, opaque projector or projection microscope, depending upon the particular type and size of the object being analyzed, i.e., an actual object, microfilm, photomicrograph, photographic slide, negative, positive or the like. the mechanism 20 is preferably mounted on suitable means in the form of a carriage 22 which is slidable on a support surface 24 to provide for longitudinal sliding movement of the mechanism 20 relative to the conveying mode 14 so that the size of the image or pattern produced by the mechanism 20 may be adjusted, as will later be described. the image produced by the mechanism 20 is adapted to be transmitted to the conveying mode 14 which, in the exemplary embodiment described herein, comprises a vertically extending first surface mirror 26 that is disposed at a 45 degree angle from the line of projection of the mechanism 20. the mode 14 also includes a vertically extending light image display screen 28 which is preferably constructed of a sheet of ground glass or the like and is disposed at a 45° angle from the mirror 26 and at a 90° angle from the line of projection of the mechanism 20. it may be noted that the mirror 26 is not necessary if the mechanism 20 is located directly in front of the screen 28, as will be apparent.located on the opposite side of the screen 28 from the mirror 26 is the photomeasuring mode 16 which includes a light sensitive mechanism 30 that is adapted to produce an electrical signal in accordance with the intensity of light transmitted through the screen 28 and hence in accordance with the degree of lightness or darkness of the image produced on the screen 28 by the mechanism 20. the signal thus produced by the light sensitive mechanism 30 is adapted to be transmitted to the data recording mode 18 which functions in a manner later to be described.as best illustrated in fig. 1, the photomeasuring mode 16 includes a masking shield member 32 which is spaced from and extends substantially parallel to the screen 28 interjacent the light sensitive mechanism 30 and the screen 28. the masking member 32 is formed with a narrow elongated horizontally extending slit or aperture 34 which is preferably as long as the width of the image produced on the screen 28 by the mechanism 20, the aperture 34 being formed in the member 32 at a position aligned with the light sensitive mechanism 30, as seen in fig. 2. the width of slit 34 is greatly exaggered in fig. 2, and is actually very small as indicated in the specific example given hereinafter. the member 32 and mechanism 30 are preferably in a unitized assembly and mounted for incremental indexed movement in a vertical direction parallel to the screen 28, as indicated by the arrow 35 in fig. 2. means in the form of an electrically or spring powered carriage assembly, representatively indicated in fig. 2 by the numeral 36, is provided for such vertical indexed movement, the assembly 36 preferably being adjustably operable so that the rate of indexing and height of incremental movement of the mechanism 30, shield member 32, relative to the one side of the screen 28 may be adjusted.it may be noted that in analyzing certain types of patterns or images produced on the screen 28 by the mechanism 20, a suitable light condensing apparatus may be interposed between the light sensitive mechanisms 30 and the aperture 34 of the masking member 32. means providing for such condensing is representatively shown at 37 in fig. 1.referring now to the data recording mode 18, the electrical signals produced by the light sensitive mechanism 30 are adapted to be transmitted to an output recording system 38 which may be in the form of a strip recorder or other suitable recording apparatus (not shown). the system 38 is connected with a coding or data assigning system 40 which functions to assign scalar, numerical or other values to the signals received by the system 38. inasmuch as the signals from the photoelectric means 30 are in analog form, known types of analog-todigital converters may be used to produce digital values from the corresponding analog signals. the data thus produced by the system 40 is adapted to be transmitted to a coding station 42 that translates the data into a form suitable for computer storage and analysis. this data is then in turn transmitted to a data recording station 44 which places the data on punch cards, paper or magnetic tape, or any other suitable form to be processed in an associated computer network (not shown).to facilitate correlating the various component members and operational modes of the above described photomeasuring device 10, a brief description of an exemplary operational cycle thereof will now be given.initially, the object to be analyzed is placed within the image producing mechanism 20, i.e., slide projector, projection microscope or the like. the mechanism 20 is then adjusted relative to the surface 24 until the size of the pattern produced thereby is as large as a reference area or format of a predetermined size on the screen 28. in particular, the mechanism 20 is adjusted so that one end of the pattern is aligned with one end of the format and the pattern is thereafter enlarged or expanded, as by moving the projector 20 along the surface 24, until another edge of the pattern is aligned with one other edge of the format.after the above described image sizing and positioning procedure has been completed, the assembly comprising the masking member 32 and light sensitive mechanism 30 is positioned such that the aperture 34 of the member 32 is located at one end of the pattern being produced on the screen 28. the mechanism 30 is then energized whereby the density of that portion or element of the image with which the aperture 34 and mechanism 30 register is sensed by the mechanism 30, at which time the assembly 36 is indexed causing the member 32 to be moved incrementally in a vertical direction as seen in fig. 2. the distance that the assembly 36 moves is approximately equal to the width of the aperture 34 which, for example, wheen the object is a 21/4 inch × 31/4 inch photo transparency, is approximately 1 mm. as soon as the assembly 36 has been indexed, the mechanism 30 will automatically sense the density of the next element, this procedure being repeated until the member 32 and mechanism 30 have traversed the entire height of the image on the screen 28.as the mechanism 30 thus moves across the image, it will produce an electrical signal for each incremental position it is moved to, each of these signals corresponding in intensity and/or magnitude in direct proportion to the density value of the particular narrow elongated area of the image. this group of serial density signals is then transmitted to and recorded by the output recording system 38 and is assigned suitable numerical or similar values by the system 40. these values are thereafter transmitted to the coding station 42 and the coded values are sent to the recording station 44 to be recorded on suitable means for processing in the associated computer network, as above described.it will be seen from the foregoing description that the photomeasuring device 10 of the present invention will readily lend itself to measuring and recording various characteristic density patterns of a multiplicity of different objects from books, pictures and the like, to animal tissues having various disease peculiarities, so that comparisons can be made between the density pattern of unknown objects and objects which are already stored in the memory system of the associated computer network, for example, between tissues having lesions of known pathogenicity and prognosis with other tissue of other unknown potential. more particularly, it is contemplated that the associated computer network will include storage and retrieval sections, the former of which will be adapted to store the data obtained from the objects being studied, which data will be characteristic of a particular known pattern, object, or known diseased or nondiseased tissue or similar specimen. the retrieval section will be adapted, upon appropriate actuation thereof, to retrieve a specific prerecorded range of data representative of a known object for the purpose of numerical or similar comparison with the data provided by the photomeasurement of a specimen of unknown prognosis. it is also contemplated that the associated computer network may be programmed for maximum or minimum leniency or deviation from data of known objects so that if the data of an unknown object falls within the limitations of the program, the computer will "recognize" the unknown object for the purposes of evaluation, storage or the like. a particular computer can be programmed such that the deviation or leniency is varied considerably so that the matrices of a multiplicity of unknown objects will fall within a general category or class.it may be noted that for certain applications, the masking shield 32 and light sensitive mechanism 30 may be fixedly mounted, and the modes 12 and 14 may be movable relative to the member 32 in the manner such that the pattern produced on the screen 28 traverses across the aperture 34 on the screen 32, whereby the mechanism 30 will sense the density values of the patterns, as above described. this type of construction particularly lends itself to an arrangement where two or more light sensitive mechanisms 30 could be used in conjunction with one another, the separate mechanism 30 being read out on individual channels for achieving greater density resolution along the length of the aperture 34 as the pattern moves relative thereto.a particular feature of the photomeasuring device 10 of the present invention resides in the fact that a given set of data representative of a particular object or pattern is substantially linear throughout the density ranges under which it operates and thereby lends itself to accurate interpretation and analysis. it may be noted that a single specific code or series of digits will be assigned to each particular object so that each set of digits can be statistically manipulated. related systems heretofore known and used have utilized a matrix concept wherein plotted intersecting data distributions comprising thousands to millions of points define a particular object. since each of these points can vary in any direction, a standard deviation of a particular object, for all practical purposes, is impossible to obtain. in the system of the present invention, the serial density values of the object are obtained along a single plane and are of low enough magnitude to permit convenient manipulation. object representation can be grouped into "classes" and be compared with other objects or classes.another feature of the present invention will be seen from the fact that the photomeasuring process may be accomplished in a relatively short period of time to provide for rapid analysis, evaluation and pattern comparison. still another feature of the present invention will be seen from the fact that objects or specimens of virtually any size and structure may be studied and evaluated, from single cellular structures to complete objects such as pictures, books and the like. furthermore, the above described apparatus of the present invention, by virtue of being constructed of readily available components, it economical to commercially manufacture.while it will be apparent that an exemplary embodiment herein illustrated is well calculated to fulfill the objects above stated, it will be appreciated that the present invention is susceptible to modification, variation and change without departing from the proper scope or fair meaning of the subjoined claims.ch_client = "fpo";

{"data_track_clickback":true};addthis button endpaging_filterthe new object recognition system could allow computers in the future automatically to search through hours of video footage for a particular two-minute scene; intelligence analysts should be&nbsp;happymitresearchers havedevelopeda computer that can recognize objects using a newly developed algorithmic technique. their object recognition system could allow computers in the future&nbsp;automatically to&nbsp;search through hours of video footage for a particular two-minute&nbsp;scene.the researchers also envision smart-phone applications where a tourist walking down a street in a strange city could take a photo of an unmarked monument and immediately find out what it&nbsp;was.it could also improve internet searches of images. for example, if a search engine was told to look for &#8220;shakespeare,&#8221; it would pull up pictures of shakespeare and not pictures of gwyneth paltrow in the movie shakespeare in&nbsp;love.typically, object recognition algorithms need to be trained using digital images of objects that have been outlined and labeled. by looking at a million pictures of cars labeled &#8220;car,&#8221; an algorithm can learn to recognize features shared by images of cars. the problem is that for every new class of objects (trees, buildings, telephone poles) the algorithm has to be trained all over&nbsp;again.the object recognition system developed by themitresearchers does not require any training. yet, it is claimed it still identifies objects with 50 per cent greater accuracy than any previous&nbsp;algorithm.the system uses a modified version of what is known as a motion estimation algorithm, a type of algorithm common in video&nbsp;processing.since consecutive frames of video usually change very little, data compression schemes often store the unchanging aspects of a scene once, updating only the positions of moving&nbsp;objects.the motion estimation algorithm determines which objects have moved from one frame to the next. in a video, that is a relatively easy task because most objects don&#8217;t move very far in one-30th of a&nbsp;second.the algorithm also does not need to know what the object is. it just has to recognize, say, corners and edges, and how their appearance typically changes under different&nbsp;perspectives.themitresearchers&#8217; new system essentially treats unrelated images as if they were consecutive frames in a video sequence. when the modified motion estimation algorithm tries to determine which objects have moved between one image and the next, it usually picks out objects of the same type. it will guess, for instance, that the 2006 infiniti in image two is the same object as the 1965 chevy in image&nbsp;one.if the first image comes from the type of database used to train computer vision systems, the infiniti will already be labeled car. the new system will transfer the label to the&nbsp;chevy.the greater the resemblance of the labeled and unlabeled images, the better the algorithm&nbsp;works.themitteam has developed a demonstration web-based system called labelme that lets online volunteers tag objects in digital images. they also created a website called 80 million tiny images that sorts the images according to subject&nbsp;matter.it is claimed that when confronted with an unlabeled image, the new object recognition algorithm will find something similar in the computer database. as the database grows larger, that likelihood has the potential to&nbsp;increase.&nbsp;more stories:computers /

new technique for optical pattern recognition with two-center recording of persistent holograms in doubly doped linbo3:fe:mn crystal is presented, by which the holograms are localized in separate slices along the recording medium. the localized recording method has the distinctive advantage of selective recording and erasure of the individual holograms without affecting the entire holographic recording medium. this capability enables dynamic content modification of the optical pattern recognition systems. also, the diffraction efficiency of localized holograms is much larger than that of the normal volume multiplexed holograms. it is theoretically shown that the localized holographic correlator (lhc) outperforms the conventional volume holographic correlators in terms of crosstalk, shift invariance, and capacity. the lhc is experimentally demonstrated. several persistent holograms are localized within separate slices as close as 33 mum apart along the crystal. the excessive diffraction efficiency of the localized holograms is employed to enhance the lhc robustness through multiplexing several holograms per pattern within individual slices of the recording medium.","my_library_url":"https://www.google.com/accounts/login?service=print\u0026continue=http://books.google.co.in/books%3fop%3dlibrary\u0026hl=en","is_magazine":false,"is_public_domain":false},{"enableuserfeedbackui":true,"pseudocontinuous":true,"imageservers":[{"numservers":10,"serverformat":"bks%d.books.google.co.in"}],"asyncadsenabled":true,"currentversion":"_e8e544c9d08fea0870b6ebbb75426545","usemodularviewport":true,"maxprintablepages":20,"enableembedding":true,"addvol2collectionbaseurl":"http://books.google.co.in/books?op=add\u0026sig=acfu3u3-om1tdf9krn8yts7gbgnjwtnqvq\u0026id=rp40pw8igaoc","removevolfromcollectionbaseurl":"http://books.google.co.in/books?op=remove\u0026sig=acfu3u13vfylktmr3blwfuaawmeyqpqanw\u0026id=rp40pw8igaoc","enablefeedbackquality":false,"enablep13n":true,"enableplusone":true,"purchasehelpurl":"http://books.google.co.in/support/bin/answer.py?answer=179845\u0026hl=en-in","logged_in":false,"p13n_save_user_settings_url":"http://books.google.co.in/books?op=edit_user_settings\u0026sig=acfu3u3jlyncos3sluvojhhelwlk_xgzxw","is_cobrand":false,"sign_in_url":"https://www.google.com/accounts/login?service=print\u0026continue=http://books.google.co.in/books%3fid%3drp40pw8igaoc%26pg%3dpa17%26lpg%3dpa17%26dq%3d%2522object%2brecognition%2522%2b%2522storage%2bsystems%2522%26source%3dbl%26ots%3dmhgcuzailj%26sig%3d5t-iguozd5subqhqgrivlacmbf0%26hl%3den%26sa%3dx%26ei%3dmxa8t9ozas2c-wb1vqax\u0026hl=en","is_play_enabled":true},{"page":[{"pid":"pa17","src":"http://books.google.co.in/books?id=rp40pw8igaoc\u0026pg=pa17\u0026img=1\u0026zoom=3\u0026hl=en\u0026ots=mhgcuzailj\u0026sig=acfu3u127vlhoj22non7_7x1cyapcugcoa","highlights":[{"x":475,"y":196,"w":28,"h":12},{"x":101,"y":222,"w":52,"h":12},{"x":457,"y":378,"w":28,"h":12},{"x":101,"y":404,"w":52,"h":12},{"x":180,"y":535,"w":71,"h":12}],"flags":0,"order":38,"uf":"http://books.google.co.in/books_feedback?id=rp40pw8igaoc\u0026spid=aflre702kpoti0wfhxnima8j5gnzcotwt31wvndnqkgdmrl1kbn_tjg\u0026ftype=0","vq":"\u0026quot;object

with the acquisition of fundamental knowledge on the equilibrium theory and process kinetics of protein adsorption in chromatography. the systems involved in the studies include dye-ligand affinity adsorption, hydrophobic adsorption and ion-exchange or electrostatic adsorption. predictive models for the salt effect on dye-ligand and hydrophobic adsorption equilibria have been established and ph and ionic strength dependence of model parameters in the steric mass-action model is studied based on chromatography and batch adsorption experiments. in addition, we have performed extensive studies on diffusion models describing the adsorption process of proteins by finite batch adsorption and chromatography incorporating visualization of intraparticle concentration profiles by confocal laser scanning microscopy. these are expected to contribute to the development of chromatography theory of proteins.1.2. molecular simulation of adsorption and chromatographyseparation and purification are the key steps for the production of proteins expressed by recombinant dna technology, and chromatographic methods plays the central role in the downstream processes. there are various chromatographic methods based on the different interactions between ligands and proteins, such as affinity chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (hic), ion exchange chromatography (iec), and hydrophobic charge induction chromatography (hcic). the microscopic behavior in various chromatographic processes is crucial for the separation process and performance. research in this area is mainly concerned with the microscopic description of adsorption mechanism and its implications to protein chromatography by molecular simulations. the systems involved in the studies include modeling of adsorbents, adsorption and desorption processes, protein conformational transition within adsorbent pores. at present, a coarse-grained adsorbent pore model of hcic has been established. protein adsorption, desorption and conformational transition in the hcic pore and its implications to the separation performance has been extensively by molecular dynamics (md) simulations. moreover, researches into the molecular and microscopic performance of affinity adsorption and displacement chromatography are ongoing. the efforts would not only offer better understanding of the processes, but also be beneficial for the rational design of relevant separation materials and the process  optimization towards high-performance protein chromatography.1.3 rational design of affinity ligandsaffinity chromatography (ac) is an adsorptive chromatography based on the specific interaction between a protein and its ligand immobilized on a solid matrix. due to the high selectivity and purification power, ac has become one of the best ways to the purification of biomolecules. however, the difficulty in the use of ac is the lack of specific ligands for the target molecules. so, our research focus on ac has recently been shifted toward selecting and designing ligands of high affinity and specificity. flexible docking simulation has been used to screen peptide libraries and affinity peptide ligands have been screened for several proteins. at present, the screening strategy has been extended to a comprehensive approach consisting of amino acid location, molecular docking, molecular surface analysis and md simulations. the approach is expected to help fast and reliable design of new and robust affinity ligands for therapeutically important proteins such as monoclonal antibody.1.4 mixed-mode chromatographyion-exchange chromatography (iec) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (iec) for protein purification operation have some limitations, such as loading at low ionic strength for iec and at high ionic strength for hic, and limited loading capacity of hic due to low ligand density. mixed-mode chromatography (mmc) uses charged or chargeable chemical ligands that bind proteins by different mechanisms, such as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi stacking. this kind of chromatography is more flexible in protein purification operations.one of the mmc is sometimes known as hydrophobic charge induction chromatography (hcic). hcic is based on the application of an ionizable and dual-mode ligand containing a heterocyclic structure and ionizable group. generally, phenolic, pyridyl and imidazolyl derivatives are considered to be the most suitable candidates as ligands for hcic. dual-mode ligands developed for hcic are very similar to those used in hydrophobic interaction chromatography (hic) except that a high ligand density is employed. at such a high ligand density, protein can bind to chromatographic beads over a wide range of salt concentrations by hydrophobic interaction, exhibiting typical salt-independent characteristics, whereas hydrophobic binding of protein to hic beads (having a low density of hydrophobic ligand) is promoted with lyotropic salts. therefore, clarified feedstock can be applied to chromatographic step without the adjustment of ph and ionic strength. elution of bound protein is easily accomplished by electrostatic repulsion between protein and ionized ligand after buffer ph is modulated to mild acidic conditions (3.5-5.5), in which the ligand takes on a net positive charge because of the dissociation of the ionizable group. hcic is currently considered as a potential alternative to protein a chromatography in the purification of antibodies. up to now, only a couple of commercial hcic beads (e.g., mep hypercel) are available. moreover, the development of hcic ligands specifically designed for high value-added recombinant and natural proteins and the exploitation of corresponding chromatographic processes suitable for industrialized production are other important topics in this field. a deep insight into the mechanism of protein binding is crucial to these researches mentioned herein. this subgroup is currently engaged in the following topics: (1) the development of novel hcic ligands for antibodies, recombinant proteins and natural proteins from tissue fluids (e.g. blood); (2) a thorough understanding of thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors in protein binding on hcic beads immobilized with the new ligands. recently, several exclusive ligands have been discovered, which show attractive properties for the selective binding of antibodies and other proteins in a salt-independent manner. in thermodynamic studies, isothermal titration calorimetric measurement and adsorption isotherms are combined to find the binding mechanisms. an example is lysozyme binding to histamine-sepharose; the result indicates that there is typical enthalpy-entropy compensation in protein adsorption on the bead and the adsorption is initiated by the dehydration of protein and ligands.1.5 development of novel mediaadsorption chromatography is one of the main techniques for bioseparations, and the design of high-performance solid matrices (adsorbents) is a main task in the development of efficient chromatographic technology. one research in this field has concentrated upon the design and fabrication of novel solid matrices with high column efficiency, high throughput, and low backpressure in biomacromolecular chromatography. to this end, we have developed novel methods for preparation of bidisperse porous materials. the methods for creating gigapores involve the incorporation of micron-sized solid granules and (w/o)/w emulsification. the gigapores created as such provide channels for intraparticle convective flow of mobile phase, so the interior mass transport is greatly intensified. moreover, micropores (diffusive pores) connecting the gigapores provide a large surface area for high-capacity protein adsorption. thus, the solid phase can be made with high column efficiency and dynamic capacity at mobile phase flow rate up to 30-50 cm/min. this implies that the adsorbents are promising for the high-speed purification of proteins and plasmid dna for gene therapy.1.6 electrochromatographypreparative electrochromatography has showed its huge potential in protein separation. however, in the commercial application, some overwhelming challenges have to be faced, including the generation of joule heat and electrolysis gas. our goal in this research area is focused on the development of high efficient, stable electro-chromatography system in virtue of the redesign of column architecture and deep understanding in electo-kinetic mechanism in electrochromatography. recently, an electrochromatography with an oscillatory transverse electrical field was proposed. due to the electric field is perpendicular to column axis, only a low voltage was needed to keep the suitable field strength in the column. in order to meet the requirement of introduction of electric field, the novel three-compartment chromatography column was designed, in which the column compartment and electrode compartments was separated by ceramic plate filled with polyacrylamide gel. being packed with sephadex g-75, the novel-designed column with a height of 12 cm showed a complete resolution of the mixture of bovine serum albumin and myoglobin.1.7 expanded-bed adsorption and magnetically stabilized fluidized bedexpanded bed is a low back¨cmixing liquid fluidized bed achieved by the purpose-design of column configuration and solid matrix with a defined size and/or density distribution. expanded bed technique offers potential advantages of both packed and fluidized beds. the upward flow through the bed of adsorbent provides higher void fraction within the bed, which makes it possible for particulate materials to pass through whilst the target bioproduct is adsorbed to the solid phase. the purpose-design of the column and adsorbents could ensure the expanded bed in an identical way to a packed bed chromatography to purify desired products from an unclarified feedstock. we have investigated the size and density distributions of two commercial media, and developed a mathematical model to express the size and concentration distributions of solid phase in expanded bed system. a theoretical model for the separation process has also been developed and evaluated based on the above studies. various proteins including recombinant human interferon are purified by the expanded bed adsorption technology. for effective application of the expanded bed technology, our research also concentrates on the development of composite small-sized dense pellicular solid phase for expanded bed adsorption of proteins.similar to expanded bed, magnetically stabilized fluidized bed (msfb) is a low back-mixing liquid fluidized bed of magnetically susceptible supports by applying a weak, external magnetic field oriented axially or transversely relative to the flow. as an attractive alternative to conventional column chromatography, the liquid msfb exhibits a combination of the properties of both packed and fluidized bed. these include the efficient fluid-solid mass transfer properties, elimination of solid mixing, low-pressure drop, resistance to clogging, and continuous counter-current operation. the lab has fabricated a novel magnetic agarose support for application in msfb, which shows even somewhat higher dynamic capacity in msfb than that in the packed bed. current work is concerned with the elucidation of particle size and concentration distributions in msfb and their dependence on various operating conditions.1.8 reverse micellesamphiphilic molecules dissolved in organic solvents can self-organize to form thermodynamically stable reverse micelles containing nanometer-sized water droplets. the water pools can accommodate proteins, enzymes and nucleic acids, so reverse micelles have potential applications in bioseparation, biocatalysis, protein refolding and protein structure studies. this group has devoted to design new reverse micellar systems with for biotechnology application. the reverse micellar systems we have developed include new nonionic surfactants-based reverse micelles, dye-ligand affinity reverse micelles and metal-chelate affinity reverse micelles. the new reverse micelles show advanced performance in selective protein extraction. the current efforts are made to apply the metal-chelate reverse micelles to the purification and refolding of his-tagged proteins overexpressed inescherichia coli.1.9 two-phase aqueous micellar systemssurfactant molecules dissolved in water can form self-assembly micelles. under appropriate conditions, the homogeneous aqueous micellar solution spontaneously separates into two macroscopic phases, both containing micelles, but one having a higher and the other having a lower surfactant concentration. biomolecules will partition unevenly in the system attributed to the difference in physical-chemical properties between the micelle-rich and the micelle-poor phases. in addition, the high water content provides a gentle environment for biomaterials. so two-phase aqueous micellar systems have potential applications in the separation, purification and concentration of proteins. this group has been devoted to design new two-phase aqueous micellar systems for biotechnology applications. the current efforts are made to design metal-chelating two-phase aqueous micellar systems for the purification of his-tagged proteins overexpressed inescherichia coli.1.10 plasmid dna purificationthe interest in plasmid dna (pdna) has recently increased due to the rapid evolution of gene therapy and dna vaccines. in gene therapy applications, non-viral vectors would be preferred in clinical applications to minimize the risk of viral infection. this increases the demand for large-scale processes to manufacture pdna of a high level of purity for use as therapeutic agent. liquid chromatography is one of the most effective methods for the analytical and preparative separations of bio-molecules. currently, pdna and dna vaccines have been purified by different types of chromatography such as gel filtration, ion-exchange, reversed-phase, hydrophobic interaction, hydroxyapatite, and affinity chromatography as well as other adsorbents. we have developed biporous adsorbents for high-speed plasmid purification by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and thiophilic interaction chromatography in a flow-through mode. now, we are involved in the development of novel affinity ligands for the purification of supercoiled plasmid dna from its isomers (open circular and linear plasmids).back&nbsp;

martin sch&ouml;nhofpublications of martin sch&ouml;nhoftheoretical vs. empirical classification and prediction of congested traffic statesauthors:dirk helbing,martin treiber,arne kesting,martin sch&ouml;nhof03/2009;starting from the instability diagram of a traffic flow model, we derive conditions for the occurrence of congested traffic states, their appearance, their spreading in space and time, and thestarting from the instability diagram of a traffic flow model, we derive conditions for the occurrence of congested traffic states, their appearance, their spreading in space and time, and the related increase in travel times. we discuss the terminology of traffic phases and give empirical evidence for the existence of a phase diagram of traffic states. in contrast to previously presented phase diagrams, it is shown that &quot;widening synchronized patterns&quot; are possible, if the maximum flow is located inside of a metastable density regime. moreover, for various kinds of traffic models with different instability diagrams it is discussed, how the related phase diagrams are expected to approximately look like. apart from this, it is pointed out that combinations of on- and off-ramps create different patterns than a single, isolated on-ramp. comment: see http://www.helbing.org for related workautonomous detection and anticipation of jam fronts from messages propagated by inter-vehicle communicationauthors:martin sch&ouml;nhof,martin treiber,arne kesting,dirk helbing12/2006;in this paper, a minimalist, completely distributed freeway traffic information system is introduced. it involves an autonomous, vehicle-based jam front detection, the information transmission viain this paper, a minimalist, completely distributed freeway traffic information system is introduced. it involves an autonomous, vehicle-based jam front detection, the information transmission via inter-vehicle communication, and the forecast of the spatial position of jam fronts by reconstructing the spatiotemporal traffic situation based on the transmitted information. the whole system is simulated with an integrated traffic simulator, that is based on a realistic microscopic traffic model for longitudinal movements and lane changes. the function of its communication module has been explicitly validated by comparing the simulation results with analytical calculations. by means of simulations, we show that the algorithms for a congestion-front recognition, message transmission, and processing predict reliably the existence and position of jam fronts for vehicle equipment rates as low as 3%. a reliable mode of operation already for small market penetrations is crucial for the successful introduction of inter-vehicle communication. the short-term prediction of jam fronts is not only useful for the driver, but is essential for enhancing road safety and road capacity by intelligent adaptive cruise control systems.jam-avoiding adaptive cruise control (acc) and its impact on traffic dynamicsauthors:arne kesting,martin treiber,martin sch&ouml;nhof,florian kranke,dirk helbing02/2006;adaptive-cruise control (acc) automatically accelerates or decelerates a vehicle to maintain a selected time gap, to reach a desired velocity, or to prevent a rear-end collision. to this end, the accadaptive-cruise control (acc) automatically accelerates or decelerates a vehicle to maintain a selected time gap, to reach a desired velocity, or to prevent a rear-end collision. to this end, the acc sensors detect and track the vehicle ahead for measuring the actual distance and speed difference. together with the own velocity, these input variables are exactly the same as in car-following models. the focus of this contribution is: what will be the impact of a spreading of acc systems on the traffic dynamics? do automated driving strategies have the potential to improve the capacity and stability of traffic flow or will they necessarily increase the heterogeneity and instability? how does the result depend on the acc equipment level? we discuss microscopic modeling aspects for human and automated (acc) driving. by means of microscopic traffic simulations, we study how a variable percentage of acc-equipped vehicles influences the stability of traffic flow, the maximum flow under free traffic conditions until traffic breaks down, and the dynamic capacity of congested traffic. furthermore, we compare different percentages of acc with respect to travel times in a specific congestion scenario. remarkably, we find that already a small amount of acc equipped cars and, hence, a marginally increased free and dynamic capacity, leads to a drastic reduction of traffic congestion.coupled vehicle and information flows: message transport on

hoc network based on local interactions. as vehicle and information propagation occur on similar time scales, the network dynamics strongly influences message propagation, which is done by the movement of nodes (cars) and by hops between nearby nodes: two cars within the limited broadcast range establish a dynamic link. using the cars of the other driving direction as relay stations, the weak connectivity within one driving direction when the density of equipped cars is small can be overcome. by analytical calculation and by microscopic simulation of freeway traffic with a given percentage of vehicles equipped for inter-vehicle communication, we investigate how the equipment level influences the efficiency and velocity of information propagation. by simulating the formation of a typical traffic jam, we show how the non-local information about bottlenecks and jam fronts can travel upstream and reach potential users.adaptive cruise control design for active congestion avoidanceauthors:arne kesting,martin treiber,martin sch&ouml;nhof,dirk helbingtransportation research part c: emerging technologies.we present an adaptive cruise control (acc) strategy where the acceleration characteristics, that is, the driving style automatically adapts to different traffic situations. the three components ofwe present an adaptive cruise control (acc) strategy where the acceleration characteristics, that is, the driving style automatically adapts to different traffic situations. the three components of the concept are the acc itself, implemented in the form of a car-following model, an algorithm for the automatic real-time detection of the traffic situation based on local information, and a strategy matrix to adapt the driving characteristics (that is, the parameters of the acc controller) to the traffic conditions. optionally, inter-vehicle and infrastructure-to-car communication can be used to improve the accuracy of determining the traffic states. within a microscopic simulation framework, we have simulated the complete concept on a road section with an on-ramp bottleneck, using empirical loop-detector data for an afternoon rush-hour as input for the upstream boundary. we found that the acc vehicles improve the traffic stability and the dynamic road capacity. while traffic congestion in the reference scenario was completely eliminated when simulating a proportion of 25% acc vehicles, travel times were already significantly reduced for much lower penetration rates. the efficiency of the proposed driving strategy even for low market penetrations is a promising result for a successful application in future driver assistance systems.criticism of three-phase traffic theoryauthors:martin sch&ouml;nhof,dirk helbingtransportation research part b: methodological.after introducing the history and main points of three-phase traffic theory, we continue with a critical discussion based on its theoretical features and empirical traffic data. our data originateafter introducing the history and main points of three-phase traffic theory, we continue with a critical discussion based on its theoretical features and empirical traffic data. our data originate from the german freeway a5 close to frankfurt, i.e. from the same freeway section that has been the basis for the development of three-phase traffic theory. despite of this, we end up with partially different interpretations of the observations. in particular, we highlight findings that are inconsistent with three-phase traffic theory and facts that question the concept of a &ldquo;general pattern&rdquo; of congested traffic flow. finally, we discuss some open problems that call for the development of improved traffic models and further empirical studies.modelling widely scattered states in &lsquo;synchronized&rsquo; traffic flow and possible relevance for stock market dynamicsauthors:dirk helbing,davide batic,martin sch&ouml;nhof,martin treiberphysica a: statistical mechanics and its applications.traffic flow at low densities (free traffic) is characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional relation between traffic flow and vehicle density, while no such fundamental diagram exists for &lsquo;synchronized&rsquo;traffic flow at low densities (free traffic) is characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional relation between traffic flow and vehicle density, while no such fundamental diagram exists for &lsquo;synchronized&rsquo; congested traffic flow. instead, a two-dimensional area of widely scattered flow-density data is observed as a consequence of a complex traffic dynamics. for an explanation of this phenomenon and transitions between the different traffic phases, we propose a new class of molecular-dynamics like microscopic traffic models based on times to collisions and discuss the properties by means of analytical arguments. similar models may help to understand the laminar and turbulent phases in the dynamics of stock markets as well as the transitions among them.are you martin sch&ouml;nhof?claim your profileco-authors of martin sch&ouml;nhoftop primary authorsdirk helbing(2)arne kesting(2)top secondary
